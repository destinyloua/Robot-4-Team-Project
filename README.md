This is the packet definition for the robot assignment. It allows for data communication between a windows machine and a robot simulator application. 

## Execution Instructions

Simulation Test:
1) Run the robot simulator application. 
2) Run the Main.cpp file in the C++ source code. 
This simulation creates a packet with the DRIVE command with hardcoded values for direction, duration and speed. It demonstrates how a packet will be sent to the robot. (NOTE: this simulation is for debugging and testing purposes only. We may make changes in later stages depending on the project's progress.)

Unit Tests: 
1) Run all tests from the ROBOT4_TESTS Native Unit Test Suite. 
These tests ensure the core functionality of the packet definition work as required. More tests may be added later, as necessary.
